# Virial Theorem

- For a gravitationally bound system in equilibrium:
  $$2\langle T\rangle + \langle U \rangle = 0$$
  where T = kinetic, U = potential energy.
- Mass estimate:
  $$M = \frac{3 \sigma^2 R}{G}$$
  where:
    - Ïƒ = velocity dispersion (km/s)
    - R = cluster radius (Mpc)
    - G = gravitational constant
- Applies to systems in equilibrium (e.g., galaxy clusters).
