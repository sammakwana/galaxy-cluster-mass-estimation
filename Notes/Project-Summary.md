# Project Summary

This project estimates the dynamical mass of a simulated galaxy cluster using the virial theorem.  
Developed during ISA Summer School 2025, it covers:
- Galaxy simulation (positions & velocities)
- Velocity dispersion & mean radius calculation
- Mass estimation using virial theorem
- Visualization and interpretation of results
