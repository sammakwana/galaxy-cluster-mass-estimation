# Galaxy Cluster Mass Estimation using the Virial Theorem

🎓 **ISA Summer Internship 2025 – Astronomy & Astrophysics**  
🏫 Vishwakarma Government Engineering College, Chandkheda  
👨‍💻 Project by: Samir Hiteshbhai Makwana

## 🌌 Overview

This project estimates the **dynamical mass of a galaxy cluster** using the **Virial Theorem** on simulated data (100 galaxies).  
Developed as part of my **ISA Summer Internship**, this repo is both a **project showcase** and a **learning resource** for anyone interested in astrophysics and galaxy dynamics.

## 📊 Method Used

- Simulate 3D positions & line-of-sight velocities of 100 galaxies
- Calculate velocity dispersion and mean radius
- Apply the virial theorem to estimate mass:

\[
M = \frac{3 \cdot \sigma^2 \cdot R}{G}
\]

- Plot galaxy distribution and velocity histograms
